# CMI Puzzle Hunts

Ever since 2025, I normally serve as the puzzle setter for CMI's puzzle hunts.

The format for these hunts usually have 6 puzzles with the answers being things on the campus. Some questions use specifics from CMI culture. Some of the questions have not been put up as I didn't set them and hence, didn't have them at time of making the repo. Will add them all at some point of time.
