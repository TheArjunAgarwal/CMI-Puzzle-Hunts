# CMI Puzzle Hunts

Since 2025, I’ve been serving as the puzzle setter for **CMI’s Puzzle Hunts**.

These hunts typically feature **six puzzles**, with the **answers referring to locations or things on the CMI campus**. Some puzzles also include references to **CMI-specific culture and/or inside jokes**.

Not all the puzzles are currently uploaded as few were set by others and weren’t available at the time of creating this repository. I plan to add those as and when I get them.
